- âœ… Confirm rendering updates each frame in the game loop

---

## Statistics Overview

### Lines of Code Added
- **Anna**: 605 LoC total
  - `src/game/board.py`: 39
  - `tests/test_board.py`: 71
  - Legacy code refactoring: 495
- **Cody**: 159 LoC total
  - `src/game/piece.py`: 141
  - `src/figures.py`: 18
- **Owen**: 77 LoC total
  - `src/game/game.py`: 36
  - `src/view/pygame_renderer.py`: 41

**Total**: 841 lines of code

---

## Anna's Progress: Board Implementation

### Major Achievements
- **Board Class Creation**: Refactored board implementation into dedicated `Board` class
- **Import System**: Standardized imports with `from src.game.board import Board`
- **Legacy Code Cleanup**: Eliminated global `Field` variable, simplified board operations
- **Unit Testing**: Created 5 comprehensive unit tests for Board class

---

### Key Changes
```python
# Before: Global variables and functions
Field = [[0 for _ in range(Width)] for _ in range(Height)]

# After: Encapsulated Board class
GameBoard = Board(height, width)
GameBoard.clear_full_lines()
```

---

## Cody's Progress: Piece System Design

### Major Achievements
- **Piece Class Design**: Created comprehensive Piece class with movement/rotation
- **Data Organization**: Moved piece data to `figures.py` and colors to `constants.py`
- **Code Quality**: Improved readability with better variable names and structure
- **Modularity**: Eliminated magic numbers, centralized configuration

---

### Key Changes
```python
# Before: Hard-coded piece data scattered throughout code
# After: Centralized, modular approach
from src.game.piece import Piece
from src.figures import FIGURES
from src.constants import COLORS
```

---

## Owen's Progress: Rendering System

### Major Achievements
- **Renderer Class**: Created dedicated `PygameRenderer` class
- **Separation of Concerns**: Moved rendering logic out of main game file
- **Frame Updates**: Confirmed rendering updates every frame in game loop
- **Clean Integration**: Simplified main loop with encapsulated rendering

---

### Key Changes
```python
# Before: Inline rendering in main loop
for i in range(len(board)):
    for j in range(len(board[i])):
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, colors[board[i][j]], ...)

# After: Clean renderer calls
renderer = PygameRenderer(screen)
renderer.draw_board(GameBoard)
renderer.draw_piece(current_piece)
```

---

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality Enhancements
- **Modularity**: Separated concerns into dedicated classes
- **Testability**: Added comprehensive unit tests
- **Maintainability**: Eliminated global variables and magic numbers
- **Readability**: Improved variable names and code structure

---

### Architecture Benefits
- **Encapsulation**: Board and Piece logic now properly encapsulated
- **Import System**: Standardized, reliable import paths
- **Separation**: Rendering, game logic, and data cleanly separated

---

## Current State Assessment

### Functionality Status
- âœ… **Board System**: Fully functional with proper class structure
- âœ… **Piece System**: Designed and implemented with movement/rotation
- âœ… **Rendering System**: Working with frame-by-frame updates
- âœ… **Testing**: Unit tests in place for core components

---

### Integration Status
- **Import System**: Standardized import patterns established in each branch
- **Dependencies**: Encapsulated classes ready for integration
- **Code Quality**: Significantly improved from original implementation

---

## Challenges Overcome

### Technical Challenges
- **Import Resolution**: Fixed module path issues when running from different directories
- **Legacy Code**: Successfully refactored complex global state into clean classes
- **Branch Coordination**: Team members working on separate branches with consistent patterns

### Process Challenges
- **Coordination**: Team members working on separate branches with overlapping concerns


---

## Next Steps (Week 3)

### Anna's Plan
- Implement line clearing logic with comprehensive tests
- Handle edge cases and cleanup
- Prepare Board class for integration with other components

### Cody's Plan
- Integrate Piece class into existing game code
- Implement collision detection
- Add unit tests for movement and rotation

---

### Owen's Plan

- Complete rendering system integration
- Begin work on main game loop

### Integration Goals
- **Merge all branches** into main branch
- **Resolve any conflicts** between Board, Piece, and Renderer implementations
- **Test integrated system** to ensure all components work together

---
