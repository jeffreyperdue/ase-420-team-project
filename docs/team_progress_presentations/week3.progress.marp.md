## Major Technical Achievements

### Board System Optimization (Anna)
- **Bitmask Implementation**: Moved from 2D arrays to `Row` bitboards
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced memory footprint with bitmask approach
- **Performance**: Quick full-row checks using bitwise operations
- **Data Structure**: Implemented `LinkedList` for row management

---

### Input System Implementation (Owen)
- **Keyboard Mapping**: Created comprehensive key-to-intent mapping system
- **Event Processing**: Implemented `InputHandler` class for event abstraction
- **Game Integration**: Seamlessly integrated input system into main game loop
- **Debug Support**: Added intent logging for development and testing

---

## Key Architecture Changes

### 1. Constants Centralization
```python
# src/constants.py - 28 LoC
HEIGHT = 20  # number of rows
WIDTH = 10   # number of columns
```
- **Purpose**: Single canonical source for board dimensions
- **Benefit**: Eliminates magic numbers across codebase

---

### 2. Board Class Enhancement
```python
# src/game/board.py - 66 LoC
class Board:
    def __init__(self, height, width):
        self.__height = height
        self.__width = width
        self._rows = LinkedList()
```
- **Encapsulation**: Fully encapsulated board operations
- **API**: Clean methods for cell access and line clearing
- **Integration**: Ready for teammate collaboration

---

### 3. Row Bitmask System
```python
# src/game/row.py - 63 LoC
class Row:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__bits = 0
        self.__colors = {}
    
    def is_full(self):
        return self.__bits == self._mask
```
- **Memory**: Compact bitmask representation
- **Performance**: O(1) full-row detection
- **Scalability**: Efficient for large boards

---

### 4. LinkedList Implementation
```python
# src/utils/linked_list.py - 44 LoC
class LinkedList:
    def append(self, value)
    def insert_top(self, value)
    def delete_node(self, index)
```
- **Purpose**: Row-level operations support
- **Operations**: Quick top insertions and deletions
- **Integration**: Seamless board management

---

### 5. Input System Architecture
```python
# src/view/input.py - 22 LoC
class InputHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.key_map = {
            pygame.K_UP: "ROTATE",
            pygame.K_LEFT: "LEFT", 
            pygame.K_RIGHT: "RIGHT",
            pygame.K_DOWN: "DOWN",
            pygame.K_SPACE: "DROP",
            pygame.K_RETURN: "START"
        }
```
- **Purpose**: Abstract pygame events into game intents
- **Mapping**: Comprehensive keyboard controls for Tetris gameplay
- **Integration**: Clean separation between input and game logic

---

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Test Statistics
- **test_board.py**: 64 LoC (5 comprehensive tests)
- **test_linked_list.py**: 35 LoC (linked list operations)
- **test_row.py**: 27 LoC (bitmask functionality)
- **Total Test LoC**: 126 lines

### Test Quality
- **Line Detection**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Line Clearing**: Edge case handling
- **Data Structures**: LinkedList and Row validation
- **Integration**: Board API testing

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before vs After
```python
# Before: Global variables and 2D arrays
Field = [[0 for _ in range(Width)] for _ in range(Height)]

# After: Encapsulated bitmask system
GameBoard = Board(HEIGHT, WIDTH)
GameBoard.clear_full_lines()
```

### Benefits Achieved
- **Encapsulation**: Proper OOP design
- **Performance**: Bitwise operations for speed
- **Memory**: Reduced memory footprint
- **Maintainability**: Clean, testable code
